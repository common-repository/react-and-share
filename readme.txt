== Description ==

This plugin enables WordPress users to integrate React & Share tools on their site easily.
Get feedback with customizable reaction buttons that allow your readers to give feedback with one anonymous click â€” trusted by communications teams in companies and government sector.

== Installation ==

1. [Contact us](https://reactandshare.com) and get started with your subscription.
2. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly (Plugins -> Add new -> Search for "React & Share") or upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/react-and-share` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
4. Get the API key from us after subscribing the service.
5. Paste API key into your Settings page
6. ALL SET!

When React & Share is activated, Reaction Buttons are shown on each post by default.

In the settings you have two choices:

1. Show buttons by default
2. Don't show buttons by default

In each case you can override the global setting in the edit post view.

**Short code and page template installation **

* If you want to place the buttons manually to your post: use the short code `[rns_reactions]` in the edit post/page mode.
* If you want to add React & Share to your page templates, use this code inside a php tag: `if (function_exists('rns_reactions')) { rns_reactions(); }`.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why should I use React & Share reaction buttons? =

Site owners tell us that while their traffic numbers look good, people comment and share their posts less than before. One-click reactions - similar to Facebook or Linkedin - are a great way to activate your readers and get valuable feedback on your articles.
People react up to 30 times more than they comment!
